# Internationalization

App is translated to many different languages using `ui/i18/*.ts` files. Translations are done by contributors through lokalise.com platform.

## TLDR

1. Update *.ts files: `lupdate ui/nim-status-client.pro`
2. Upload *.ts files to lokalise.com
3. Download translated *.ts files from lokalise.com
4. Create translation binaries `lrelease ui/i18n/*.ts`
5. Commit updated *.ts and *.qm files

## Updating translation files

Updating the QML translation files is very easy, as it comes with QT directly. It will scan all files in the projects (those listed in the `SOURCE` section of the `.pro` file) and then add or modify them in the XML-like `.ts` files.

Just run `lupdate nim-status-client.pro` in the `ui/` directory.

## Generating binary translation files

To have the final translation files that will be used by the app, just run `lrelease i18n/*.ts` in the `ui/` directory
